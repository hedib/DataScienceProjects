##Data science projects involving Inferential Statistics, EDA, and machine learning modeling.

## Data Science Projects
This repository includes different data science projects involving data wrangling, Inferential statistics, exploratory analysis and machine learning modeling

## project_Inventory is the complete data science project. 
Product backorders is a typical supply chain problem. Backordering happens when a customer places an order for a product that is temporarily out of stock with the vendor and order cannot be fulfilled. It is a dream for any business, but it is also a massive problem if we do not know how to handle it. 
In this project, the goal is to identify the cause of backorder and use the past data around the backorders to develop a model to predict the probability of a product backorder. With the help of data analysis, a reasonable prediction on all products can go on backorders is expected. Such a prediction could immensely help the client to plan for a more efficient stocking and backorder handling. Goals of this project are:
Provide an overall insight from data using exploratory data analysis.
Identifying what the main features are caused backorders the most.
Predict the probability of a product would go on backorder.
I performed the following:
*Data Wrangling
	* Handling missing values
	* Handling the outliers
	* Data trend analysis
	* Relationship among features
	* Data questioning
	* Model training and validation
	* train-test split the data
	* Model training
	* Model tuning and cross-validation
	* Model evaluation
