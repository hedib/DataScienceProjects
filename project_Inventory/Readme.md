Product backorders is a typical supply chain problem. Backordering happens when a customer places an order for a product that is temporarily out of stock with the vendor and order cannot be fulfilled. It is a dream for any business, but it is also a massive problem if we do not know how to handle it. 

The client is looking for ways to improve backorders handling. With the help of data analysis, a reasonable prediction on the products that can go on backorder is expected. Such a prediction could immensely help the client to plan for a more efficient stocking and backorder handling.

In this project, I used the dataset available on the Kaggle website. The training data file contains the historical data for the eight weeks before the week in which we are trying to 
predict product backorders. 

The dataset was acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/tiredgeek/predict-bo-trial, and it consisted of one file named "Training_Dataset."
The training file was opened and stored in a data frame using python.
